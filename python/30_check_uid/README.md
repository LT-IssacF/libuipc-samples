# Check UID Availability

This example demonstrates how to check the availability of UIDs (Unique Identifiers) for constitutions and implicit geometries in the Libuipc library.

Before you add your own constitutions or implicit geometries, it's important to ensure that the UIDs you intend to use are not already taken. This can help prevent conflicts and ensure that your custom elements are uniquely identifiable within the system.
